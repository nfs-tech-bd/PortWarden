# PortWarden
PortWarden is a fast and stealthy TCP port scanner written in Python. It scans all 65,535 ports with multi-threaded speed, shows open ports in real-time, saves results to JSON, and gives detailed service names for commonly used ports â€” perfect for penetration testing, CTFs, or network reconnaissance.
